# [The Truth About doing business in China from Alibaba, Didi Chuxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqlTtEm-FS8) 
misperception about China:
    Is there real innovation ? Are they all copycats ?

Innovation is the key growth engine in China right now. According to a McKinsey report, I would say up to 25% of chinese economy is driven by Internet these days.

And China is also the first central government to legalize ride-sharing on a national wide on our industry, which is very encouraging. So I would say innovation is everything in China right now.

I think there is a little bit of envy as well. It's hard to believe that things like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu could have actually been created in a country like China, given all of the enormous constraints that are imposed in that markets, and relative to the freedom, the capital, the ability to innovate and do things particularly on this coast of United States.

It's very clear in China, consumption and services are goning up, but manufacturing and exports are going down.

So this is the new generation, unlike our own generation, we like to save for rainy days. They don't think they can save enough to buy a property anyways, so why not just spend ? This is the new generation that embodys China's transition.

The share economy.

The Chinese government: "We encourage entrepreneurship, we encourage innovation".
