<dt><a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"><cite>The
Elements of Statistical Learning</cite> (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)</a>
</dt><dd>This will be our principal textbook for the first part of the course.  It's written by three statisticians who invented many of the techniques discussed. Despite its popularity and the pretty pictures, this is not an easy book.  There's an easier version of this book that covers many of the same topics, described below. (Available for free as a PDF.)

</dd><dt><a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><cite>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</cite> (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)</a>
</dt><dd>This book is written
by two of the same authors as The Elements of Statistical Learning. It's much less intense mathematically, and it's good for a lighter introduction to the topics. (Available for free as a PDF.)

</dd><dt><a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage"><cite>Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning</cite> (David Barber)</a>
</dt><dd>We'll use this as a reference for probabilistic modeling, including Bayesian methods, and Bayesian networks. (Available for free as a PDF.)

</dd><dt><a href="https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/PRML/"><cite>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</cite> (Christopher Bishop)</a>
</dt><dd>This book is another very nice reference for probabilistic models and beyond.  It's highly recommended.

</dd><dt><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html"><cite>Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</cite> (Kevin P. Murphy)</a>
</dt><dd>This book covers an unusually broad set of topics, including recent advances in the field. As such, it's a great reference to have, particularly if you continue your study of data science beyond this course.  That said, it was the required textbook for this course in 2015, and
many students found it a bit overwhelming. It's really intended as a comprehensive, PhD-level textbook.

</dd><dt><a href="https://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/"><cite>Convex Optimization</cite> (Boyd and Vandenberghe)</a>
    </dt><dd>This book was an instant hit in the machine learning community when it was published in 2004.  We will be making light use of this book, mostly for its coverage of Lagrangians and duality.  However, it's a good book to get familiar with, as it's very
well written, and it covers a lot of techniques used in more advanced machine learning literature. (Available for free as a PDF.)
